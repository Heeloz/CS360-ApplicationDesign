# CS360-ApplicationDesign

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The goal of this app was to allow for users to create or log in to a user profile and view inventory information they've created. The user can create, update, or delete items they wish to and view them in a list view. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  There were 5 different screens used for this app. The main app is where a user can log in or click the "Create new user" button to create a new profile. From clicking this button, they will be brought to a new screen to create their profile. Once logged in, they will see all items they've created and entered. There is a plus button in the lower right to create new items. If they create a new item it will ask for the item name, item number, and quantity. From there the item will display in the list and they will then be able to interact with them. If they click on an item they can update the item name, item number, quantity or delete the item. My UI design kept the user's needs in mind by allowing them to create and login, create, update and delete items while being compact and user friendly. The designs were successful because it created a simple UI that allowed the user to interact with the application to their full needs.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I broke each component down into small sections and started from creating the login UI, then the backend logic. Then created the "create new user" screen and then the backend functionality as well. Once the user could log in or create a profile I moved to creating the list view of their items. Then moved onto creating items and then lastly being able to interact with the items. The main technique I used was an agile approach with building a little bit, then testing what I built. I would test with unit tests, interactive tests, and then user testing as well. These techniques could be implemented into any project and allow for easier debugging and more responsive apps. 

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I completed unit, integrated, and user testing of my app. This is important to understand if anything isn't working properly on your application or if there are unknown bugs. 

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  I had to innovate in casting types of data to work with my database and change one later on to work with the data I was supplying. 

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I think I was successful in demonstrating my skills in my ability to create friendly and user centered UIs. As someone that uses apps daily, I've taken my skills and knowledge from various apps in order to create an app that would be easy for any user to use and understand.
